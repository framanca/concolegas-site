# Privacy Policy (EN) – Concolegas

**Last updated:** 2026-01-18

Concolegas (“the app”) is a party games and scoreboards app. This Privacy Policy explains what data is collected, how it’s used, and your choices.

## 1) Controller and contact

**Controller:** Concolegas
**Support contact:** [soporte@concolegas.com](mailto:soporte@concolegas.com)

## 2) Data we process

### 2.1 Data you provide

* **Emails or messages you send** to [soporte@concolegas.com](mailto:soporte@concolegas.com) (message content and your email), used only to reply and support you.

### 2.2 Data collected automatically

The app may use third-party services that collect certain technical data, such as:

* Device or advertising identifiers (e.g., advertising ID), approximate IP, device model, OS version, language, time zone, usage events, and diagnostic data.
* Crash logs to improve stability.

### 2.3 In-app content

* Games, settings, and scoreboards are typically stored **on your device**.
* If you use **online/multiplayer** features, some gameplay data may be processed to provide the service (e.g., room code, game state, player names/avatars if enabled).

## 3) How we use data

We use information to:

* Provide and maintain app functionality.
* Improve performance, fix bugs, and understand feature usage.
* Show ads and measure ad performance (if the app displays ads).
* Respond to support requests.

## 4) Advertising (AdMob or other ad networks)

The app may display ads using **Google AdMob** or other advertising partners.
These partners may use advertising identifiers and similar technologies to:

* Serve ads, limit frequency, measure performance, and prevent fraud.

You can manage advertising identifiers and personalization options in your device settings:

* **iOS:** Settings > Privacy & Security > Apple Advertising (and tracking permission if applicable).
* **Android:** Settings > Google > Ads (or Privacy > Ads, depending on your version).

## 5) Third parties

Depending on enabled features, the app may integrate services such as:

* **Google AdMob (Google LLC)** for ads.
* **Firebase (Google LLC)** for online features, analytics, or diagnostics (if enabled).

These providers may process data under their own privacy policies.

## 6) Legal basis

Where applicable (e.g., in the EU), we rely on:

* **Legitimate interests** to maintain and improve the app (diagnostics and security).
* **Performance of a contract/service** when you use online features.
* **Consent** where required (e.g., personalized ads/tracking on iOS if applicable).

## 7) Data retention

* Support emails: as long as needed to handle your request and comply with legal obligations.
* Technical/diagnostic data: kept only as needed for app improvement and security, depending on app configuration and provider settings.

## 8) Children’s privacy

The app is intended for general audiences and may be used by families.
If you are a parent/guardian and believe a child has sent us personal data via support, contact **[soporte@concolegas.com](mailto:soporte@concolegas.com)** and we will handle it.

## 9) Your rights

If applicable (e.g., GDPR in the EU), you may request access, correction, deletion, objection, restriction, or portability where relevant.

To exercise these rights, email **[soporte@concolegas.com](mailto:soporte@concolegas.com)** and describe your request.

## 10) Security

We use reasonable safeguards to protect information. No method is 100% secure.

## 11) Changes to this policy

We may update this policy. We will publish the updated version here and update the “Last updated” date.
