      <li><strong>Device information</strong>: device model, OS version, language, and app version.</li>

      <li><strong>Crash and performance data</strong>: error logs and performance metrics to help us improve stability.</li>
      <li><strong>Multiplayer or online features</strong> (if enabled in the App): data required to provide those features, such as game room identifiers and gameplay state.</li>

    <p class="small">

      If you share information with us by email, we will use it only to respond to your request.
    </p>

    <h2>3. How we use information</h2>
    <p>We use the information for the following purposes:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>To provide and maintain the App and its features.</li>
      <li>To operate multiplayer or online functionality when used.</li>
      <li>To show advertising and measure ad performance.</li>
      <li>To detect and prevent fraud or abuse.</li>
      <li>To fix bugs, improve performance, and enhance user experience.</li>
      <li>To communicate with you when you contact support.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses advertising services. These services may collect and process information such as
      advertising identifiers, IP address, device information, and approximate location (derived from IP)
      to provide, personalize, and measure ads, and to prevent fraud.
    </p>
    <p>
      In particular, the App may use Google AdMob and related Google services to deliver ads.
      You can learn more about how Google uses information from apps at Google’s privacy resources.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Third party services</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses third party services to operate, improve, and monetize the App. Depending on the features you use,
      these may include services such as:
    </p>
    <ul>

      <li>Google Firebase (for app infrastructure and optional online features)</li>
      <li>Apple and Google app distribution services (App Store and Google Play)</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These providers may process data in accordance with their own privacy policies and may act as independent controllers
      for certain processing activities.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Sharing of information</h2>
    <p>We may share information in the following cases:</p>
    <ul>

    </ul>

    <h2>7. Data retention</h2>
    <p>
      We retain information only as long as needed to provide the App, comply with legal obligations, resolve disputes,
      and enforce our agreements. Some third party providers may retain data under their own policies.
    </p>

    <h2>8. International transfers</h2>
    <p>
      Your information may be processed in countries other than your own. Where required, we rely on appropriate safeguards
      for international transfers, such as standard contractual clauses.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Your choices and controls</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Advertising choices</strong>: You can limit ad personalization via your device settings
        (for example, Apple “Allow Apps to Request to Track” and Android ad controls).

      The App is intended for a general audience. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under the
      minimum age required by applicable law without appropriate consent. If you believe a child provided personal data,
      contact us and we will take appropriate steps.
    </p>
